                                Begin by adding a project on the project screen. You can add as many projects as you
                                like and delete ones you no longer need by long-pressing on them. \n\n
                                Tapping on a project name will take you to an individual page for that project. There you
                                can add and delete individual names. \n\n
                                Select an option from each of the three spinners and tap \'Get Names\' to see
                                all the names available. Tap a name to choose it. \n\n
                                Now, enough jabbering. Add your name below to get started! Happy Choosing!</string>
